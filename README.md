# .NET-Core-Banking-System

This is one of my favorite projects, I did it during my studies at Nackademin. Online Banking Portal is a website for banking services. 
This site helps customers to perform banking transactions by sitting in their office or at home via PC or laptop. 
It is a well-designed and secure website for conducting online banking transactions. In this project I tried to show how a bank account system works and 
cover the basic functions of an online banking system.

Techniques have been used: 
JavaScript, jQuery, Ajax, C #, .NET Core, Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft Azure
